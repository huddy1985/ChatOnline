This is a C++ wrapper API for sqlite3, strictly following the ideas
of libpqxx (http://pqxx.org/). This is a learning piece of software
more for myself learning to do decent C++ libraries than to be
published code, use at your own risk.

other Sqlite3 C++ wrappers:

- sqlite3x http://wanderinghorse.net/computing/sqlite/

- ADO DB like sqlite3 wrapper http://dev.int64.org/sqlite.html:
  very simple, main focus is to provide a Windows ADO DB interface
  for the most simple functions

- http://svn.paglo.com/paglo_open_source/crawler/trunk/src/CppSQLite3.cpp

- libpqmm on SourceForge, announced and registered, but no code yet

- http://blog.earthbrowser.com/2009/05/sqlite-c-wrapper-so-you-dont-have-to.html:
  with overloaded shift operators instead of functors for parameter binding.

- http://www.alhem.net/project/sqlite/diagram.html: a series of C++
  APIs for set of databases and also for Sqlite

- recycle internal prepared statements, the question is when?
  best if the result reaches a final state and instead of resetting
  the statement we unprepare it
- sqlite_changes gives back the number of rows affected of the last
  command (non-query), queries must result 0
- check types in param defition with bind parameters on invocation
- sort out interface regarding character set encoding
- find out whether we have bind parameters or not during execution
  of a statement and dynamically prepare the statement. but not for
  things like 'BEGIN' where the result is nodata always.
- why are strings always bound to the first passed parameter?
- why is the type always SQLITE_NULL?
